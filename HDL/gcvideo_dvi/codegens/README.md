This directory contains two code generators for GCVideo-DVI which
generate the microcode and infoframe ROMs for the enhanced DVI
encoder.

To run them, just use `make`.

Alexios Chouchoulas' [mcasm](http://www.bedroomlan.org/projects/mcasm)
must be installed to successfully generate the microcode ROM.
